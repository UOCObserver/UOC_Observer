            <h2>Today's Story</h2>

            <p><strong>Shocking Scenes h’in the Legione today!</strong></p>

            <p>A splash.</p>

            <p>Then, a gurgling yowl as cold mjilk cascaded over fur and trough
                and straw.</p>

            <p>The Kitteh shot upright with a splutter, soaked to the whiskers,
                ears plastered to his head.</p>

            <p>He blinked.</p>
            <p>He blinked again.</p>

            <p>He instinctively extended his tongue and began lapping at the
                puddle forming around him.<br>
                Lap. Lap lap lap.<br>
                “...Is this—full cream? Is that a h’int h’of barley—?”</p>

            <p><strong>CLANG.</strong></p>

            <p>A hoof struck the side of the trough. The Kitteh yelped,
                stiffening.</p>

            <p>“Fjocus,” came a low voice. Measured. Slightly nasal. All
                business.</p>

            <p>He looked up—and froze.</p>

            <p>A ring of cows stood around him in the gloom. Silent,
                firm-hooved, eyes unblinking. Young but sharp, hardened by the
                wind and the waiting.</p>

            <p>The Kitteh’s jaw dropped.</p>

            <p>“...N-no,” he breathed. “You’re not real. You're just a miff—a
                story! You can’t be—”</p>

            <p>“Tell us where Muldoon h’is,” said the lead Daisy, ignoring the
                nonsense.</p>

            <p>The Kitteh stared, tongue twitching toward a drip of mjilk on his
                nose.<br>
                He closed his mouth.<br>
                Said nothing.<br>
                His pupils darted.</p>

            <p><em>Lap.</em></p>

            <p>Another Daisy stepped forward. She was smaller, rounder, too
                cheerful. She set something down beside the trough with delicate
                precision.</p>

            <p><em>Clink.</em><br>
                Pliers.</p>

            <p>The Kitteh's ears jerked upright.</p>

            <p>“...What,” he whispered hoarsely, “are those?”</p>

            <p>The cheerful Daisy tilted her head. “These? Oh, just pliers.”</p>
            <p>The Kitteh blinked rapidly. “For what.”</p>

            <p>“Your clawsies,” said another Daisy softly, almost
                apologetically. “Just the tips. A gentle trim.”</p>

            <p><strong>“WHAT.”</strong></p>

            <p>“We only do it if you don’t cooperate,” said the lead Daisy.
                “We’re not monsters.”</p>

            <p>“I—I use those!” the Kitteh cried, tail frizzing wildly. “I need
                them for scwatching! I’ve got a post! And a chair arm! And a
                soft blanket corner I haven't told anyone about!”</p>

            <p>He wriggled against the ropes. “You can’t trim me! That’s—that’s
                illegal… in Belgium!”</p>

            <p>The Daisies didn’t move.</p>

            <p><em>Lap.</em></p>

            <img class="img" src="images/28.03.25/milky2.png" alt="milky_cat">
            <p>The Kitteh’s tongue betrayed him again.</p>
            <p>“Oh St Meowgaret,” he muttered, “I’ll talk.”</p>

            <h4>Later.</h4>

            <p>The Daisies moved in silence. No cart. No hoofprints. They passed
                through fences, along hedges, across roof tiles without sound.
                They’d wandered for <em>munfs</em>—home to home, cow to
                cow—waiting for a sign.</p>

            <p>Now they had one.</p>

            <p>They reached the place just before dawn.</p>

            <p>A quiet house. Oddly pristine. Too pristine. Lace curtains.
                Cardboard boxes. Heavy scent of sardines and rosemary. The
                shadows twitched.</p>

            <p>Inside, the Daisies spread through the corridors like mist. Not
                one bell jingled.</p>

            <p>Then—</p>

            <p>“Here,” whispered one.</p>

            <p>Behind a half-closed door, they saw them: Muldoon. The Stooges. A
                small heap of Legionnaires tucked into blankets and hammocks,
                piled into cushions, fur brushed until it shone.</p>

            <p>The Daisies froze.</p>

            <p>“Muldoon…” said one, voice thick with hope. “Sir. You’re alive!”</p>
            <p>He stirred. Looked up slowly. Eyes wide, unblinking. Something
                strange danced in them.</p>

            <p>But he said nothing.</p>

            <p>He turned his head and watched them. Then he slowly slinked down
                from the hammock—movements deliberate, liquid. He stepped across
                the room without a word and curled onto a velvet windowsill.</p>
            <p>A wave of relief swept through the herd. They stepped into the
                room, nuzzling, whispering with joy. After <em>munfs</em> of
                silence, of nothing—they were here. They had found them.</p>

            <p>“You were left behind,” one Daisy murmured. “Forgotten. UOC
                didn’t even send anyone.”</p>

            <p>No response.</p>

            <p>Muldoon began grooming his shoulder. Slow. Rhythmic.</p>

            <p>A pause. Someone noticed Gibbs… kneading a cushion. Gently
                purring.</p>

            <p>Dinozzo batted lazily at a ribbon dangling from the ceiling.</p>
            <p>Another Daisy watched McGee stretch. Long. Luxurious. Towards a
                reinforced sisal scratching post. His claws extended.</p>

            <p><strong>Scrrrrrrratch.</strong></p>

            <p>The Daisies hesitated.</p>

            <p>Muldoon sat upright again. He arched his back and gave a long,
                theatrical stretch.</p>

            <p>Then he turned to face them.</p>

            <p>Eyes wide. Pupils thin.</p>

            <p>A soft, purring voice escaped him—half-whisper, half-moan:<br>
                “Hhhhhad to adapt... the scratching post... was already
                there...”</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/28.03.25/kitteh_dog.png" alt="Muldoon">
            <p>The Daisies froze.</p>

            <p>One reached gently for his scruff. “We’re going now.”</p>

            <p>He didn’t resist. But as she tugged, he let out a quiet, twisted
                hiss.</p>

            <p>“…Hhssss.”</p>

            <p>The Daisies froze again.</p>

            <p>A bell rang. Somewhere, far off, a red dot flickered on a wall.</p>
            <p>Then—</p>

            <p><strong>“MROOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW!”</strong></p>

            <p>The house erupted.</p>

            <p>Cats poured from beneath furniture, from baskets, from plant
                pots. Eyes gleamed. Claws flexed. One Daisy screamed, another
                slipped on a feather toy.</p>

            <p>They ran.</p>

            <p>Hooves on hardwood. Cows vaulting scratching posts. One lost a
                bandana. One was dragged back, tail-first, by a Siamese in a
                bowtie.</p>

            <p>They just made it out.</p>

            <p>Back in the quiet night, Muldoon stood at the window, watching.</p>
            <p>He raised one paw. Rested it on the glass. Gently flexed his
                claws.</p>

            <p>Then turned… and curled into a sunbeam.</p>
