            <h2>The Hjunt h'of Pyro</h2>

            <p>I'm running fhwough the hedges suwwounding UOC, Muldoon h'is
                h'orchestwating the chase h'and they h'iz closing h'in h'on
                their pway. A bang, a sparkle, a firework fhwown h'in the
                diwection h'of a pursuing Kittej buys me some time, but the pack
                h'is gaining.</p>

            <p>I set the caffhwine wheel down h'into the djirt h'and light the
                fjuse, running h'as fjast has I can! The pursuing kittejs behind
                h'are mesmerised h'at the twirling, the whirling, the beauty
                h'of ljife.</p>

            <p><em>"H'Idiots,"</em> says Muldoon gwumpily. He picks h'up the
                tjin can phone h'and speaks h'into h'it. Grand Vizier H'Allen
                h'is h'on the h'uvver h'end:</p>

            <p><em>"The h'emperor h'is shocked! A direct attempt h'on his
                    thwown! Who knows h'if he'll h'ever wecover his compurrsure.
                    H'It h'is h'of the h'utmjost h'impjortance dat you bring
                    this one h'in Muldoon Pasha."</em></p>

            <p>Muldoon ponders this for a mjoment, befjore saying <em>"send them
                    h'in...h'all h'of them."</em></p>

            <p>Grand Vizier H'Allen gives h'out a gjulp h'on the phjone: <em>'H'iz
                    you sure? They wemain h'untjested...'</em></p>

            <p>A pause. A silence.</p>

            <p><em>"Sjend them h'in."</em></p>

            <img class="img" src="images/26.06.25/WitchKingTower.png" alt="Witch
                King
                observing Behbejs">

            <p>From his vantage point atop the ruined UOC tower, the Witch King
                h'of Ham-Mar (formerly known as Weggie the Pig) watched through
                slitted eyes as his Dev≈üirme-trained Behbejs mobilized. The
                former pride of Jack Russell's UOC now moved with terrifying
                precision, their once-cheerful yips replaced by mechanical
                efficiency.</p>

            <p><em>"Let them hunt,"</em> he whispered, his cloven hoof tracing
                arcane symbols in the air that shimmered briefly. <em>"The
                    fire-starter will learn what happens to those who disturb
                    the H'Empjire's peace."</em></p>

            <hr>

            <p>Pyro sits quietly h'in a twee, sjafe fwom his pursuers who has
                dwopped h'away. He didnt hecking mean to, he was h'only tjesting
                h'it h'out, h'and he hadz h'it under contwol, he hadz a fjull
                bljadder he swearsies!!</p>

            <p>A clang h'in the distance causes Pyro to stop suddenly. He peers
                h'out, his charred paws suppjorting him h'as he ljooks h'into
                the distance. The clanging h'again, rhythmic, closing h'in h'on
                him fwom h'all directions...</p>

            <p><em>"Blarbasloppa pjots! Behbejs!!"</em></p>

            <p>Pyro twies to climb higher h'into the twee but a chirruping sound
                makes him stop h'in his twacks. He looks behind but sees
                nuffink, looks back h'and for the bwieffest mjoment sees a
                Behbej stjaring back h'at him - its eyes glassy, its once-floppy
                ears now erect with military precision, the Kittej insignia
                gleaming on its collar.</p>

            <p>Pyro reaches back h'into his bag, looking for a firecwacker h'or
                a wocket that could help...a soft thud. Pyro turns h'and cjomes
                face to face wiv h'annuver Behbej, another gentle fud h'and a
                Behbej lands h'on a bwanch close by.</p>

            <p>Pyro looks h'up...h'and sees hundweds h'of fjaces ljooking down
                h'at him. He goes for a match - he dont have much tjime - h'if
                he can just get h'it lit h'in tjime he might have a chance.</p>
            <p>The ljight h'of the match hightlights a Behbej h'and he sees h'it
                twansfjorm befjore his very h'eyes - its mouth distending
                unnaturally, rows h'of needle-like teeth unfolding like some
                hellish pocketknife.</p>

            <p>A hiss. A stinging pjain h'acwoss his njose. He's fjalling,
                fjalling, fjalling.</p>

            <p>H'As he ljands h'in the h'undergwowff he feels the Behbejs
                ljanding h'on tjop h'of him, clawwing, scwatching, yowling in
                perfect unison: <em>"HE DIDNT HECKING MEAN TO SET H'IT H'ON
                    FJIRE...THIS TIME"</em></p>
