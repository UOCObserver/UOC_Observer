            <h2>Shocking Scenes h’in the Legione today!</h2>
            <h3>March 30 – The Siege of the Dashing Daisy</h3>

            <p>The morning was bright. The sky was full h’of clouds. The
                bushes hummed wivv sleepy bees.</p>

            <p>H’Allen was not enjoying any h’of it.</p>

            <p>He was dragging three bags of mjilk bones, a crumpled map, three
                umbrellas, a ladle, and a shopping list titled <strong>“To Do
                    Since January 2023”</strong>.</p>

            <p>Ten paces behind him, a Behbej bounded full tilt. Every time
                H’Allen trudged ahead, the Behbej had to race after him—legs
                skittering, tail high, nose twitching. It was a game to the pup.
                It was not a game to H’Allen.</p>

            <p>“H’Allen!” the Behbej yipped. “You forgot da mop!”</p>

            <p>“I don’t need the mop,” muttered H’Allen, “because the mop wasn’t
                on the list when I left.”</p>

            <p>“But it’s on it <em>now!</em>” said the Behbej, beaming and
                gnawing a fresh scrap of paper. “H’I updated it!”</p>

            <p>H’Allen twitched. He moved forward, eyes narrowed.</p>

            <p>“H’ALLEN! YOU FORGOT THE TINS!”</p>

            <p>Twitch. Turn. Glare. “What tins.”</p>

            <p>The Behbej produced a can opener from somewhere mysterious and
                pointed solemnly into the sky.</p>

            <p>H’Allen sighed. A full-body sigh. One that startled a nearby crow
                into immediate therapy.</p>

            <p>He turned the corner—</p>

            <p>And stopped dead.</p>

            <p>There was someone there.</p>

            <p>He squinted. “Oh. It’s… you.”</p>

            <p>The voice that answered was smooth. Familiar. It carried a smile,
                but not a warm one.</p>

            <p>They spoke. Not loud. Not long. There was a moment of laughter.
                Then a pause. H’Allen frowned.</p>

            <p>“Well, that’s not very fair. I think the record will show I’ve
                been treated quite—”</p>

            <p><strong>CLANG.</strong></p>
            <img class="img" src="images/H'Allen.png" alt="H'Allen">


            <p>A hard noise. A hollow one. Metal against bald.</p>

            <p>Silence.</p>

            <p>Around the corner, the Behbej crept—just far enough to see a
                glint of light across the stones, and a slow, thick smear of
                red-pink sludge.</p>

            <p><strong>Blarbasloppa.</strong></p>

            <p>He gasped.</p>


            <p>And bolted.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Within the hour, UOC was in uproar.</p>

            <p>Hon stood in the centre of the yard, clipboard trembling. Nigel
                was barking into a walkie talkie. Methuselah and Big Fat Behbej
                consulted the Standing Orders. Hannibal ate them.</p>

            <p>“I request permission to join the search!” barked Sergeant,
                upright, eyes burning, tail bristling.</p>

            <p>There was a pause.</p>

            <p>“You may go,” said Hon.</p>

            <p>Sergeant’s eyes lit up. “Thank you, sir. I’ll get Terry—”</p>

            <p>“YOU’RE RELIEVED,” boomed Big Fat Behbej.</p>

            <p>Sergeant blinked. “What?!”</p>

            <p>“You said Terry.”</p>

            <p>He hesitated. “Terry’s coming too.”</p>

            <p>“You’re bringing the <em>pinecone</em>.”</p>

            <p>“He’s not just a pinecone,” said Sergeant, clutching Terry
                tightly. “He’s… he’s been through things. He’s <em>seen</em>
                things.”</p>

            <p>“He’s a pinecone,” said Hon coldly. “You talk to him in
                meetings.”</p>

            <img class="terry-img" src="images/Terry.png" alt="Terry">

            <p>Sergeant produced Terry from his pocket with reverence. Terry was
                now wearing aviators and had a makeshift headset taped to his
                flaky exterior. Someone had drawn a face on him in biro.</p>

            <p>“I don’t <em>like</em> Terry,” Sergeant added, eyes wild. “I’m
                <em>not friends</em> with Terry. But Terry understands me. He
                understands <em>the wind</em>. He was the only one who noticed
                the Kitteh fog patterns last week. He—he tried to warn me!”</p>
            <p>“He’s a pinecone,” repeated Hon.</p>

            <p>“He’s our only hope,” whispered Sergeant.</p>

            <p>“You’re relieved.”</p>

            <p>Sergeant tucked Terry back into his jacket, muttering, “Don’t
                listen to them. They fear what they don’t understand.”</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Meanwhile, downriver, the <strong>Dashing Daisy</strong> was
                moored to the banks of the Taff.</p>

            <p>The Pirates were… barely upright.</p>

            <p>A night out at Spoons had turned into a longer night under a
                scaffolding tarp, and now they were groaning across the deck
                like injured accordions. The Captain’s hat was stuck to his ear.
                Someone had drawn fangs on the steering wheel. A pigeon had
                claimed the helm.</p>

            <p>They’d messaged H’Allen.</p>

            <p><em>bring treats n electrolytes u scurvy eweman</em></p>

            <p>No reply.</p>

            <p>There was a breeze. Then a rustle. Then silence.</p>

            <p>One Pirate squinted into the trees. “Anyone else see movement?”</p>
            <p>Another wiped jam off their nose. “Just wind.”</p>

            <p>The trees did not move again.</p>

            <p>Then—</p>

            <p><strong>BOOM.
                    CRACK.
                    YOWL.</strong></p>

            <p>Kitteh strike teams launched from the thickets—dozens of them,
                fast, low, armed with pompom grenades and claws honed on beanbag
                zippers. They moved like liquid and chaos. One did a triple spin
                before landing in a litter tray and flipping into cover.</p>

            <p>The Pirates roared.</p>

            <p>Sabres were drawn—bright, bendy lengths of tin foil taped to
                broom handles. Biscuit cannons were rolled forward. Squeaky
                landmines were triggered by leapfrog.</p>

            <p>“DEFENCE POSITIONS!” roared the Captain, drawing his blade (a
                sharpened fish finger taped to a stick). “THIS IS OUR DAISY!”</p>
            <p>The masts were manned. Buckets of mjilk and water were hurled
                from above. One Kitteh took a full pail to the face and let out
                a screech that caused three seagulls to abandon their nests.</p>
            <p>The Pirates held.</p>

            <p>Claws bounced off dustbin-lid shields. Yowls were met with kazoo
                calls. Gummy worms were weaponised.</p>

            <p>For a moment… it looked like UOC might hold the line.</p>

            <p>Then it came.</p>

            <p>Not a weapon. Not a blade.
                A <strong>noise</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>YOWWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL.</strong></p>

            <p>A harmonised shriek of Kittej fury and ear-piercing pitch. One of
                the Cats had hooked itself into the speaker system.</p>
            <p>The sound dropped the Pirates where they stood.</p>

            <p>Plastic sabres clattered. Eyes crossed. Two Pirates bellyflopped
                overboard voluntarily. The Captain stood wobbling, stunned, his
                good ear twitching violently.</p>

            <p>And that was it.</p>

            <p>They were surrounded.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>The survivors were lined up. Ropes, glitter tape, and elastic
                bands secured their paws. The river lapped nearby.</p>

            <p>“You have a choice,” purred the lead officer. “Join the
                H’Empjire. Wonounce King Chance. Swear fealty to the H’Emperor.”</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>

            <p>One Pirate lifted their head and spat a chewed jelly tot into the
                river.</p>

            <p>“No.”</p>

            <p>One by one, they refused.</p>

            <p>One by one, they were hurled into the Taff.</p>

            <p>Until only Captain remained.</p>

            <p>He raised his head and met the eyes of the enemy.</p>

            <p>The scarred one. The snarler. The one with one fang and an eye
                patch made from a cider label.</p>

            <p><strong>Commander Scratchulus.</strong></p>
            <img class="img" src="images/Scratulus.png"
                alt="Commander Scratulus">

            <p>“You’ll never pilot her,” the Captain growled. “The Daisy doesn’t
                obey strangers.”</p>

            <p>Scratchulus smiled.</p>

            <p>“Who needs Pirates…”</p>

            <p>He turned.</p>

            <p>“…when I have Stooges.”</p>

            <p>From the hatch behind him came three figures—groomed, regal,
                cat-like.</p>

            <p>McGee adjusted a dial with his tail. Dinozzo twirled a map on his
                paw. Gibbs purred and licked the lever.</p>

            <p>“No,” whispered the Captain.</p>

            <p>Scratchulus stepped back.</p>

            <p>The final rope was cut.</p>

            <p>The Captain tumbled into the Taff.</p>

            <p>The Daisy stirred.</p>

            <p>The boiler hissed. The vapour surged. The balloon ballooned.</p>
            <p>And slowly… slowly… the <strong>Dashing Daisy</strong> rose.</p>
            <p>A new flag unfurled.</p>

            <p>Silken purple. Trimmed in gold. Stitched with whiskers.</p>

            <p>The crest of the <strong>Kittej H’Empjire</strong>.</p>

            <p>And UOC’s flagship was gone.</p>
