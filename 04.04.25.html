            <h2>April 4 – The Rise h’of the Democratic Hippies Republic h’of UOC</h2>
            <p>A bird circled high above UOC.</p>

            <p>Its wings caught the breeze, scanning the scarred grounds below.
                Torn bunting flapped. Broken clipboards littered the fields. A
                gust carried the faint sound of muttering — something about 70s
                interest rates.</p>

            <p>The bird dove.</p>

            <p>Fast. Precise.</p>

            <p>It swept down toward the hedge, claws extended.</p>

            <p>There — tucked between the branches.</p>

            <p>It grabbed the object, twisted midair, and vanished skyward.</p>
            <p>Below, the Kittling guards kept patting each other and chasing
                shadows.</p>

            <p>They saw nuffink.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Inside UOC, <strong>Muldoon</strong> and <strong>McGee</strong>
                stepped out of Terry’s cell.</p>

            <p>Muldoon was seething.</p>

            <p>“We’s goin’ to ‘ave to tell the Emperor we still cain’t break
                ‘im…”</p>

            <p>McGee trotted beside him, tail wagging faintly.</p>

            <p>“Cheer up, fwend,” he said, nudging Muldoon. “The H’Emperor just
                put h’in a bwand new scwatching pjost! It’s got feaffers.”</p>
            <p>Muldoon grunted.</p>

            <p>“I don’t deserve a tweat. I failed.”</p>

            <p>They passed the line h’of cells. Shadows behind bars. The cold
                hum of defeat.</p>

            <p>McGee scratched at his ear. “You hear they weleased the Squire?
                To take h’out the Post Chance?”</p>

            <p>Muldoon broke stride. Just a second.</p>

            <p>How could McGee know that?</p>

            <p>He’d been down in the Interrogation Woom the whole time…</p>

            <p>But no. Must be coincidence.</p>

            <p>News spreads fast in UOC.</p>

            <p>They kept walking.</p>

            <p>Behind them, a pair of white paws poked through cell bars.</p>
            <p>A nose.</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/Hon.png" alt="Hon">

            <p><strong>Hon.</strong></p>

            <p>“The Squire…” he whispered.</p>

            <p>“Post Chance h’is going to njeed h’all the hjelp he can gets!”</p>
            <p>He pressed against the cell door.</p>

            <p>There was a creak.</p>

            <p>Was that… movement?</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Units <strong>Windflower Syndicate</strong>, <strong>Tie-Dye
                    Triumvirate</strong>, and <strong>Joplinites</strong> raced
                down the path.</p>

            <p>Leaves kicked up behind them. Vapour swirled from Weggie’s snout.</p>
            <p>“If the Squire gets to Post Chance first…” growled <strong>Sergeant</strong>.</p>
            <p>“Not cooool maaaan,” wheezed Weggie. “Not cooool…”</p>

            <p>The path forked.</p>

            <p>Sergeant halted.</p>

            <p>“He coulda gone h’any of them,” he muttered.</p>

            <p>They split.</p>

            <p>Sergeant followed his nose, his ears twitching for trouble.</p>
            <p>Then—</p>

            <p>A pathetic groan on the wind.<br>
                A monotone rant about <strong>tariffs</strong>.</p>

            <p>He’s already got to him.</p>

            <p>“Privatisation’s a good thing, you know,” came the voice. “I
                worked all me life. Nobody gave me nuffink.”</p>

            <p>A soft whimper: “uhuh…”</p>

            <p><strong>Post Chance.</strong></p>

            <p>Sergeant broke into a sprint. He had to flank. Get behind them.
                Interrupt the cycle.</p>

            <p>He leapt the hedge.</p>

            <p>Misjudged.</p>

            <p>He landed behind Post Chance, stumbled, spun—</p>

            <p>Too late.</p>

            <p>The Squire turned, already ranting.</p>

            <p>“Ah, alsatians. Used to be <em>good</em> dogs. But their hips!
                Too much breeding, that’s what it is.”</p>

            <p>“Ergh,” muttered Sergeant.</p>

            <p>“My parents were <em>military doggos</em>,” he barked.</p>

            <p>“National conscription! That’s what we need!” the Squire shouted,
                frothing. “Never did it myself, of course — but it’d be good for
                the young’uns!”</p>

            <p>Sergeant wobbled.</p>

            <p>The world tilted.</p>

            <p>He tried to rally.</p>

            <p>But the Squire was too strong.</p>

            <p>“Y’know,” the Squire began, “there never used to be problems
                here. Not ‘til the immigrants. 1976. That’s when the rot set in.
                First ones turned up—”</p>

            <p><strong>“H’it was 1979!”</strong></p>

            <p>The voice rang out — hoarse, weathered, laced with booze and
                brilliance.</p>

            <p>Sergeant blinked.</p>

            <p>He was lying over Post Chance’s collapsed body.</p>

            <p>A figure stood beside them.</p>

            <p>Grey. Hooded. Crooked.</p>

            <p>At her side, <strong>Olly Polly</strong>, the UOC parrot.</p>
            <img class="terry-img" src="images/GranDalf.png" alt="GranDalf">

            <p>“Gr… Granny? Granny Donnelly?”</p>

            <p>The figure straightened.</p>

            <p>“Days,” she rasped. “Days I hung in that hedge, so I did. Naught
                but wind, thorns, and no gin.”</p>

            <p>She lifted her chin. Her breath fogged.</p>

            <p>“The Granny you once knew is no mjore…”</p>

            <p>She flung her cloak aside.</p>

            <p>“I am… <strong>GRAN-DALF</strong>.”</p>

            <p>A pause.</p>

            <p>“I did stop h’in the H’Oak on the way here, mind.”</p>

            <p>Behind her, the Hippie units skidded into view.</p>

            <p>Weggie panted, “Granny got here first. I was gonna be Ham-dalf…”</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Granny turned to the Squire.</p>

            <p>He was mid-sentence: “…And then I told the butcher, I said—”</p>
            <p>She raised a paw.</p>

            <p>“No more, Moore. You face Granny of the First Gin. Whisperer of
                the Ancient Tongue. Dwunkle of Secrets. Servant of the Silvery
                Spirits!”</p>

            <p>The Squire blinked.</p>

            <p>“Go back to the lounge,” she roared. “You shall not <em>waffle!</em>”</p>
            <p>The ramble battle began.</p>

            <p>For every Squire anecdote, Gran-Dalf had a rebuttal. She knew
                every boring saga. She’d been there. Sometimes <em>before</em>
                it happened.</p>

            <p>Tariffs? She countered with a speech about double-duty
                consignment.</p>

            <p>1972 seed law? She quoted the <em>1971 draft.</em></p>

            <p>It lasted <em>hours.</em></p>

            <p>The Hippies dared not move.</p>

            <p>Post Chance groaned.</p>

            <p>The Squire tried to sidestep.</p>

            <p>Gran-Dalf whirled.</p>

            <p>“Didn’t ‘appen in my day!” she barked, slapping his ankle with a
                leaflet from 1963.</p>

            <p>“You’re rude! Rude is what you is!”</p>

            <p>The Squire shrank.</p>

            <p>He turned.</p>

            <p>He tried to flee.</p>

            <p>But he paused.</p>

            <p>And scooped her up.</p>

            <p>She fought.</p>

            <p>But he was too strong.</p>

            <p>She twisted, biting his ear.</p>

            <p>“FLY, YOU FOOLS!” she cried.</p>

            <p>Then vanished, taking the Squire with her.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>A wind swept the hill.</p>

            <p>The leaves turned gold.</p>

            <p>Post Chance stirred. Colour bled into his vision.</p>

            <p>A soft moo echoed in his skull.</p>

            <p>His eyes opened—</p>

            <p><strong>Sergeant.</strong></p>

            <p>Standing tall.</p>

            <p>Steady.</p>

            <p>Different.</p>

            <p>Focussed.</p>

            <p>Mysterious.</p>

            <p>Sexy.</p>

            <p>“Welcome,” he said, his voice low and proud.</p>

            <p>“To the <strong>Democratic Hippies Republic h’of UOC</strong>.”</p>
