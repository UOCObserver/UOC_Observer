            <h2>April 3 – The Squire h’is Weleased!</h2>

            <p>Shocking Scenes h'in the Kittej H'Empjire today</p>

            <p>The H’Empjire had a problem.</p>
            <p>A fast-moving, post-flinging, barcode-crushing, biscuit-ignoring
                problem.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Chance.</strong></p>

            <p>He’d taken h’out two Kittling scouts, three Skirmishers, an Evri
                courier squad and what <em>might’ve been</em> a Sainsbury’s
                driver, though it was hard to tell. The
                UOC grounds bore the scars: crushed delivery slips, snapped
                mewsment lines, a half-written complaint to DPD flapping on a
                post.</p>

            <p>So the H’Emperor summoned H’Allen to the throne room.</p>
            <p>“You know what must be done,” the Emperor growled, his voice
                silky, dangerous.</p>
            <p>H’Allen’s brow began to sweat.</p>
            <p>“My liege… surely not <em>him</em>…”</p>
            <p>The H’Emperor did not blink.</p>
            <p><strong>“Welease the Squire.”</strong></p>

            <hr>

            <p>The <strong>Squire</strong> was already waiting.</p>
            <p>Real name: <em>Howard Moore</em>.<br>
                Rumoured farmer. Confirmed menace.<br>
                He bore the energy of an angry caravan forum in human form.</p>
            <p>Barrel-shaped. Neckless. Face like a fistful of jammed fax
                machines. His coat — a beautiful green — could blind a kestrel
                at
                fifty yards. His gait? A full-body stomp. He did not walk. He
                <strong>loomed</strong>. And he came with opinions. <strong>So
                    many opinions.</strong></p>

            <img class="img" src="images/TheSquire.png" alt="The Squire">

            <p>H’Allen crept toward the gate like a guilty binbag. He knew the
                rules: do <em>not</em> engage. Do <em>not</em> look him in the
                eyes. Do <em>not</em>, under any circumstance, allow him to
                mention <em>farming subsidies</em>.</p>

            <p>He clicked the latch.</p>
            <p>“Off you go then—”</p>
            <p>“D’YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK’S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS COUNTRY?!”</p>
            <p>Time stopped.</p>
            <p>H’Allen froze. Air left his lungs. If he didn’t act now—</p>
            <p>He shoved the Squire forward and flung himself behind a water
                butt, and thought h'of Deborah.</p>

            <p>The Squire was already off, legs stomping like tanks, muttering
                about <strong>bastard H’Eddie Knowles</strong>, swinging his
                arms like threats.</p>
            <hr>

            <p><strong>Post Chance</strong> prowled the upper courtyards, eyes
                sharp.</p>
            <p>The ruins of UOC lay around him, silent but watchful.</p>

            <p>He glanced skyward. Looming above, the dark silhouette of
                <strong>UOC Tower</strong> — once the aerial control heart h’of
                the campus. Now it stood
                silent.</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/UOCTower.png" alt="UOC Tower">

            <p>Post Chance lifted his Pjone h'and spoke.</p>
            <p>Static.</p>
            <p>“…Mjoore Check?” he whispered.</p>

            <p>Nothing.</p>

            <p>He checked his coordinates again. Glanced to the hedgerow. Made
                the call.</p>
            <p>He’d proceed.</p>

            <p>Then he heard it.</p>
            <p>The gait. The weight. The wave of unrequested conversation
                radiating ahead like a fog horn of ignorance.</p>

            <p>He turned.</p>
            <p>There. Striding through the field. Coat billowing. Chin raised.
                Mouth open.</p>
            <p><strong>The Squire.</strong></p>

            <p>Post Chance’s escape routes blinked out, one by one. To flee
                would be rude. To hide — too late.</p>
            <p>He turned to face his fate.</p>

            <p>“GOT ANY POST FOR ME THEN?” the Squire bellowed. “NOT THAT IT’D
                BE ON TIME. SINCE THEY LET ALL THE BOATS IN...”</p>

            <p>Post Chance drew his satchel. A full-force swing. Right to the
                knees.</p>
            <p>It bounced off.</p>

            <p>The Squire launched into a tirade on the 1972 Seed Licensing
                Fiasco — complete with union politics and Kettering scandal.</p>
            <p>Post Chance’s ears wilted.</p>

            <p><em>“Missione… accomplished.”</em> whispered Shimmerwhisker from
                the bushes.</p>

            <hr>

            <p><strong>Somewhere in UOC…</strong></p>

            <p>“Hows he holding?”<br>
                “Fourteen hours straight. We h’aint got nuffink fwom him.”</p>
            <p>Inside the room, <strong>Terry the Pinecone</strong> sat in a
                saucer. Unmoving. Sunglasses firm. Smile unbroken.</p>

            <p><strong>Muldoon</strong> stood in front of him, tongue lolling,
                eyes wild.</p>

            <p>“So you still won’t bweak?”</p>
            <p>Terry did not respond.</p>

            <p>Then—</p>
            <p>A paw on Muldoon’s shoulder. <strong>McGee.</strong></p>

            <p>“Take a bweak, fwend. Let’s me handle this. Gjood Kittej/Bad
                Kittej h'and h'all”</p>

            <p>Muldoon nodded. Left.</p>

            <img class="terry-img" src="images/muldoonandterry.png" alt="Muldoon
                and Terry">

            <p>McGee faced Terry. Waited. Then spoke.</p>
            <p>“You just keep holding h’on, fwend.”</p>

            <p>Terry’s look didn’t change.</p>

            <p>McGee revealed his scars. “Yous weally h’upset the h’Emperor.
                He’s not a kitty to be cwossed. I ljearned the hjard way.”</p>
            <p>“The ljonger you hjold h’out… the h’angwier he gets.”</p>

            <p>The door creaked open.</p>

            <p>McGee turned. Then smiled.</p>
            <p>“You sooner than I fought… but fewer.”</p>

            <p>The <strong>Hippies</strong> entered — Hendrix Haze and the
                Ginsberg Guild.</p>
            <p>“They weleased… <strong>the Squire</strong>.”</p>

            <p>McGee’s head shook. “Kittehs’ll go to h’any lengffs.”</p>

            <p>“Muldoon won’t be ljong so I’ll be quick. Kitteh H’Empjire
                stwong. Behbejs Devşirme begun. Their wesolve h'is beginning to
                bweak, soon they’ll have loyal Behbejs
                everywhere.”</p>
            <p>“No word on Hon. They gots him locked away. Sjafe.”</p>

            <p>“Scratchulus is a bjad Kitteh. H’if we can’t get the Daisy bjack,
                we’ll never get UOC h’eiffer.”</p>

            <p>He smirked.</p>
            <p>“They h’never check UOC Tower doe. Messages can still cjome fwom
                there.”</p>

            <p>“What about Terry?”</p>

            <p>McGee smiled. “He’s tuff. H’and now… he knows he’s not h’alone.”</p>
            <hr>

            <p>The Hippies slipped out. Muldoon returned.</p>
            <p>“All quiet?”</p>

            <p>“Nuffink,” said McGee. “Not h’even a whisper.”</p>

            <p>Terry said nothing.</p>
            <p>But the vibe? <strong>Unbreakable.</strong></p>
