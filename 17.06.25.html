            <h2>June 17 - Bjad Twip Maaan</h2>

            <p>The Kittej H'Empjire stands unshaken, its paws firmly wrapped
                around the reins of UOC. The Behbejs, once wary, now move with
                the disciplined precision of true imperial subjects—though
                whether out of genuine loyalty or the simple, hypnotic allure of
                the H'Empewor's tuna-laden decrees remains a matter of hushed
                debate. The whole affair has taken on an air of inevitability,
                as if history itself had simply shrugged and said, <em>"Yes,
                    this is how things are now."</em></p>

            <p>The Hippies, for their part, had been... <em>distracted.</em> A
                particularly potent batch of vapours had left them sprawled
                around their cjampfjire in a giggling, half-conscious heap for
                <em>munfs.</em> Post Chance had tried to join in, but after four
                days of watching them stare at their own hands in slack-jawed
                wonder, he decided his talents were better spent doing what he
                did best—delivering mail and training with the Behbejs Posties
                under the cover of night. The Kittej H'Empjire's forces had
                tried to intercept him, of course. They'd sent delivery
                personnel, then threats, then even attempted to enlist the
                infamous H'Arrow XL for a good old-fashioned kitnapping. But
                H'Arrow XL never showed (probably got lost in paperwork), and
                now Post Chance moved through the streets like a shadow,
                unstoppable, <em>annoyingly</em> efficient.</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/17.06.25/witchKing.png" alt="The Witch
                King of
                Ham-Mar">

            <h3>The Kittej Council Convenes – Tuna, Treason, and Terrible Beards</h3>
            <p>In the gilded halls of the Kittej H'Empjire's inner sanctum, the
                Grand Vizier, H'Allen, presided over a meeting of the most
                powerful figures in the land. The Witch King of Ham-Mar
                (formerly known as Weggie the Pig, though <em>nobody</em> called
                him that anymore) loomed in the corner, his once-plump frame now
                draped in ominous regalia. His voice, when he spoke, was a
                reedy, venomous hiss—<em>exactly</em> the kind of voice one
                expected from a creature who had spent the last few munfs deep
                in the dark tomes of forbidden pig-lore.</p>

            <p>Reports were given:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>UOC's Remnants:</strong> Shockingly well-behaved.
                    Shenanigans were down <em>87%</em>, a statistic that made
                    Muldoon narrow his eyes in suspicion. Had they truly
                    accepted their new feline overlords, or were they simply
                    <em>waiting?</em></li>
                <li><strong>Former Legionnaires:</strong> Now enthusiastic tuna
                    enthusiasts. Some had even taken to wearing little hats in
                    the H'Empewor's colors. A few still muttered about "the old
                    days," but those mutters grew quieter with every fish-based
                    incentive.</li>
                <li><strong>Political Prisoners:</strong> A mixed bag. Some had
                    cracked under McGee Pasha's <em>persuasive</em> techniques
                    (mostly involving very loud yowling at 3 AM). Others, like
                    Hannibal, had attempted resistance—though his hunger strike
                    lasted only a few hours before he caved, muttering something
                    about <em>"needing his strength for the revolution."</em>
                    Hon, meanwhile, had grown a beard. A <em>terrible</em>
                    beard. Shimmer Whisker had taken one look at it and declared
                    it <em>"not vewy wegal-looking H'AT H'ALL,"</em> sparking a
                    heated debate about whether beards could even <em>be</em>
                    illegal.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Then came the matter of <strong>Post Chance.</strong></p>

            <p><em>"H'IS VEWY CONVENIENT,"</em> chirped one council member,
                earning a glare from H'Allen.</p>

            <p><em>"H'IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE,"</em> the Grand Vizier snapped,
                slamming a paw down. <em>"We should have stjopped this munfs
                    h'ago!"</em></p>

            <p>Muldoon nodded gravely. The Witch King merely hissed.</p>

            <h3>The Witch King Rises – "Hiiippppies... Commune..."</h3>

            <p>The Witch King of Ham-Mar had <em>embraced</em> his role. No
                longer just a pig in a fancy cloak, he had become something...
                <em>else.</em> Something that lurked in the shadows, whispering
                to forbidden spirits and practicing ominous hoof gestures in
                front of mirrors. When he spoke, the room chilled.</p>

            <p><em>"Hiiippppies... commune..."</em> he rasped, his beady eyes
                glinting beneath his hood.</p>

            <p>H'Allen swallowed hard. <em>"You h'are weady then, Ljord
                    Ham-Mar?"</em></p>

            <p>A slow, sinister nod. <em>"The nine ride h'as one."</em></p>

            <p>The Grand Vizier gulped. <em>"I shall h'infjorm the Pirates, the
                    Daisy will be with you..."</em></p>

            <p>As the council dispersed, Gibbs and McGee exchanged glances.</p>
            <p><em>"Wonderful purrrrrfjormance!"</em> murmured Gibbs.</p>

            <p><em>"Hecking h'purrrfection,"</em> agreed McGee.</p>

            <p>Behind the scenes, the Drama Department purred with pride. Their
                star pupil had <em>nailed</em> the role.</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/17.06.25/SegeantsVisione.png" alt="The
                Witch
                King of
                Ham-Mar">

            <h3>The Hippies Awaken – A Vision in the Vapours</h3>

            <p>Back at the cjampfjire, the Hippies were still lost in their
                haze. One poked at the vapours, sending a lazy puff into the
                sky. <em>"Oooooooh..."</em> they chorused, mesmerized.</p>

            <p><em>"Was we meant to be doing sumpfink...?"</em> someone slurred.</p>
            <p><em>"...no... no... m... no."</em></p>

            <p>Then—<strong>the vision struck.</strong></p>

            <p>Sergeant, sprawled in the dirt, suddenly <em>saw.</em> Colors
                exploded behind his eyes. Shapes twisted. A face formed—<em>sunglasses,
                    a scowl, sheer unbridled rage.</em></p>

            <p><strong>TERRY.</strong></p>

            <p><em>"WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN!?"</em> Terry's spectral voice
                boomed. <em>"I HAVE BEEN A PWISONER FOR NEARLY 2 MUNFS!!!!!"</em></p>
            <p>Sergeant giggled.</p>

            <p>A pinecone materialized out of nowhere and <strong>slapped him
                    across the face.</strong></p>

            <p><em>"WAKE H'UP, YOU SONS H'OF UOC! WAKE. H'UP."</em></p>

            <p>The world lurched. The ground vanished. Darkness swallowed him
                whole, and in its depths—<strong>a hiss.</strong> Not a Kittej
                hiss. Something worse. A hooded figure, hoof outstretched, voice
                like nails on slate:</p>

            <p><em>"Hiiippppies... commune..."</em></p>

            <p>The figure lunged—</p>

            <p><strong>BLINDING LIGHT.</strong></p>

            <p>Sergeant gasped, back in the real world, ears flat, tail between
                his legs. The other Hippies blinked dazedly, shaking off the
                vapours as Sergeant's howl of warning cut through the fog.</p>
            <p>Something was coming.</p>
