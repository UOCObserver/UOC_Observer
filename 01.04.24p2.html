            <h3>April 1 – A Chancinogion Special: The Roar h'of Redemption (or
                the
                Fall h'of it All) </h3>

            <p>Then, in the moment when all hope seemed lost, the sound of glass
                shattering cut through the chaos.</p>
            <p>A crash. A slosh. A hiccup.</p>
            <div class="text-center my-4">
                <button class="btn btn-warning"
                    onclick="document.getElementById('bg-music').play()">

            </div>
            <p>From behind the ruins of the biscuit cannon, staggering into
                view, came Nursy, bottle in hand. His eyeliner smeared, glowing
                faintly in the dimming light, his movements unsteady.</p>
            <p>The battlefield paused. Even the H’Emperor turned his gaze toward
                Nursy, who was barely standing, bottle raised high.</p>
            <p>With a drunken, slurred roar, Nursy yelled:</p>
            <p><strong>“NURSY 3:16 says I just whooped your… hick… ass.”</strong></p>
            <p>He lifted his paw with the bottle, his eyes glazed with a mixture
                of rage and drunken clarity.</p>
            <p>He barked.</p>
            <img class="img" src="images/Nursy3-16.png" alt="Nursy 3:16">
            <p>A mighty bark. A holy bark. A hiccupped bark.</p>
            <p>For a brief moment, the clouds parted. A shaft of light poured
                through. Flowers bloomed, their petals trembling in the newfound
                hope. The Legionnaires—exhausted, broken—lifted their heads. The
                energy they had lost began to flicker again.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>And then the H’Emperor laughed.</p>
            <p>“You think we wouldn’t h’anticipate this?” he mocked, his voice
                thick with amusement.</p>
            <p>He turned away, a lazy, dismissive gesture in his paw.</p>
            <p>“Grand Vizier. Your Emperor needs you.”</p>

            <p>In an instant, H’Allen acted.</p>
            <p>A sharp blow.</p>
            <p>A rolled-up final notice.</p>
            <p>St Chance fell.</p>
            <p>All heads turned.</p>
            <p>It was H’Allen. Silent. Cloaked in tape. His expression distant,
                cold.</p>

            <p>The bark died. The golden light faded. The battlefield froze.</p>
            <p>Then shattered.</p>
            <p>Legionnaires fled.</p>
            <p>Daisies turned tail.</p>

            <p>Hon tried to stop them—“STAND YOUR GROUND!”—but was struck across
                the muzzle by his own brother.</p>
            <p>Nigel. Clipboard splintered. Eyes wet.</p>

            <p>H’Allen dragged Nursy in a net toward the throne. Hannibal clung
                desperately to his leg, growling, biting. It made no difference.</p>
            <p>The H’Emperor, watching with cold satisfaction, nodded.</p>
            <p>“An excellent job, my Grand Vizier,” he said.</p>

            <p>H’Allen said nothing.</p>
            <p>The H’Emperor gestured. “Lock that one up too.”</p>

            <p>Captured Legionnaires were lined up like cattle. They stood,
                beaten, broken.</p>
            <p>The H’Emperor turned toward them with a cold, calculating look.</p>
            <p>“Bring Hon to my tent. We shall discuss the surrender h’of UOC.”</p>
            <p>Hon limped into the tent, defiance still burning in his eyes.</p>
            <p>“Surrender?” he spat. “I’d rather eat Shimmerwhisker’s litter
                tray.”</p>
            <p>The H’Emperor frowned.</p>
            <p>“Gaol,” he said coldly. “No matter. The Grand Vizier shall handle
                a simple task like… admin.”</p>

            <p>Hon’s eyes burned with fury as he was dragged away.</p>
            <p>The H’Emperor climbed the steps to his throne. His gaze swept
                across the broken battlefield. His voice rang out, filling the
                air.</p>
            <p>“Begin the Devşirme.”</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Behbejs were herded forward. The smallest were whisked away.
                Collars were fitted. Grooming began.</p>
            <p>UOC was broken.</p>
            <hr>
            <img class="terry-img" src="images/terry2.png" alt="Terry h'in
                H'Orbit">
            <p>Until—</p>
            <p>A flick. A glint. A blur.</p>
            <p>CRACK.</p>
            <p>The H’Emperor recoiled. Muldoon shielded him. Guards rushed
                forward.</p>
            <p>Gibbs retrieved the object.</p>
            <p>A pinecone. With sunglasses. And a determined expression.</p>
            <p><strong>Terry.</strong></p>

            <p>Somewhere in the hedge…</p>
            <p>Sergeant nodded.</p>
