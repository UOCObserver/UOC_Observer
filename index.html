            <h2>April 8 – The Sjorting h’of Fate</h2>

            <p>Tour Guide Chance adjusted his flower crown.</p>
            <p>He was ready.</p>
            <p>“Come now, fwend,” he said, tail flicking. “Let me shows you the
                wonders h’of the Democratic Hippies Republic h’of UOC!”</p>
            <p>Post Chance followed, blinking through the haze of patchouli,
                incense, and gently bubbling fruit bongs.</p>
            <p>They passed the Hammock Pavilion, the Nap Ziggurat, and the great
                Solar-Thermal-Lentil Oven (“uses vibes instead h’of fire,”
                whispered Chance).</p>
            <p>Everywhere, Hippies lounged.</p>
            <img class="img" src="images/dhru.png" alt="Democratic Hippies
                Republic H'Of UOC">
            <p>Some were painting trees. Others were chanting “H’armony over
                Hjierarchy” while passing around a bowl of “sharing pebbles.”</p>
            <p>A Hippie named Tranquil Rusty stepped forward.</p>
            <p>“We wus hurt, y’know,” he said, eyes watery. “UOC never wanted
                us. Said we smelled wrong. That we slowed fings down.”</p>
            <p>A nearby Hippie nodded solemnly.</p>
            <p>“We tried to help,” he added. “We even f’ought about joining the
                Kittehs… but their h’auras? Maaaan. So jagged. We had migraines
                for a week.”</p>
            <p>Post Chance patted him gently.</p>
            <p>“You gots a good republic now, fwends.”</p>
            <p>Tour Guide Chance beamed. “Wait ‘til yous sees our invenshuns!”</p>
            <p>They turned the corner and came face-to-face with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A kettle strapped to a bicycle (“the VeloBoil 5000”).</li>
                <li>A hammock with wheels (“for mobile stillness,” explained a
                    Hippie).</li>
                <li>A device called “The Liminal Steam Synthesiser,” which
                    turned out to be a teapot that played whale noises.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They arrived at the <strong>Debate Dome</strong>, a yurt made
                entirely from old protest signs and baked bean tins. Inside, the
                Hippies were mid-session:</p>
            <p>“Comrades,” began a stoned Labrador, “we must considers the
                redistribution h’of snacks.”</p>
            <p>Another puffed a vapour cloud shaped like a heart. “Let us build
                a system where we h’all carry one another…”</p>
            <p>The crowd murmured approval and swayed gently to acoustic sitar
                music.</p>
            <p>Post Chance sighed. “This is… peaceful.”</p>
            <p>He sat down beside them.</p>
            <p>Then noticed something in the corner.</p>
            <p>A clock. Or rather, a <strong>driftwood sun calendar</strong>
                powered by heat from nearby bong smoke.</p>
            <p>His ears twitched.</p>
            <p>His eyes widened.</p>
            <p>“Oh stjars—I’m LATE!”</p>
            <p>He bolted upright, scrambled for his bag, and launched out the
                dome in a flurry of leaflets and “sorry sorrys,” galloping
                toward the gates.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Far beyond the Lentil Walls...</p>
            <p><strong>Sergeant</strong> and the <strong>Joplinites</strong>
                crouched beneath the shade h’of the twisted fences near <strong>UOC
                    Tower</strong>.</p>
            <p>They moved as one. Steady. Precise.</p>
            <p>Inside the ruins, cobwebs stirred. The smell of abandoned
                clipboards and failure lingered.</p>
            <p>A shadow emerged.</p>
            <p>“McGee,” Sergeant growled, relaxing only slightly.</p>
            <p>“Sergeant. Fwends,” said McGee. “You should know… the Devşirme?
                It’s working. The Behbejs? They’s… different now. Sorting
                without commands. Obedient. UOC will soon be h’unconquerable.”</p>
            <p>Sergeant tensed.</p>
            <p>Then—</p>
            <p><strong>A whistle.</strong><br>Bright. Breezy. Familiar.</p>
            <p>“No…” breathed McGee.</p>
            <p><strong>Post Chance.</strong><br>Skipping down the ruined path.
                Pouch full. Spirit high.</p>
            <p>“Lovely day for delivery!” he chirped, slipping a letter through
                the door.</p>
            <p>The door burst open.</p>
            <p><strong>ShimmerWhisker.</strong></p>
            <p>Eyes wide. Hackles raised.</p>
            <p>“You! But… the Squire gots yous!!”</p>
            <p>“Mjorning,” Post Chance said cheerily.</p>
            <p>ShimmerWhisker raised his paw—but too slow.</p>
            <p><strong>BOOM.</strong><br>Sergeant collided with him like a
                freight train, sending him sprawling. He muttered “...the
                Squire...” before flopping out cold.</p>
            <p>Sergeant grabbed Post Chance.</p>
            <p>“No time. Move!”</p>
            <p>The Joplinites fell in line. The squad galloped off at
                speed—vaulting a discarded clipboard pile, darting past
                crumbling gates, tearing through the undergrowth.</p>
            <p>Only once safely beyond the edge h’of the UOC grounds did they
                stop to catch breath.</p>
            <p>“That… was close,” muttered Sergeant.</p>
            <p>Then a Joplinite blinked.</p>
            <p>“Where’s he even getting h’all h’of the letters fwom?”</p>
            <p>“The sjorting h’office h’of cjourse,” said Post Chance, like it
                was the most obvious fing in the world.</p>
            <p>Sergeant froze.</p>
            <p>Set Post Chance down slowly.</p>
            <p>“Fwend… what do yous mean… the sjorting h’office?”</p>

            <hr>

            <p><em>Tap tap tap.</em><br>A flap twitched.</p>
            <p>“‘Ees back!” came an excited voice from behind the wall.</p>
            <p><em>CLANG. CLANG. CLANG.</em><br>Locks slid back. Levers turned.
                A long hiss as the main bolt lifted.</p>
            <p>“Pjost is a vewy sensitive fing,” said Post Chance, brushing his
                fur. “Gots to keeps h’everyones info sjafe.”</p>
            <p>Sergeant tilted his head. Something… wasn’t right.</p>
            <p>The door opened.</p>
            <p><strong>Roaring. Cheering. Celebration.</strong></p>
            <p>Dozens—no—<strong>hundreds</strong> h’of <strong>Behbejs</strong>
                rushed forward.</p>
            <p>Each wore a tiny postal uniform. Each bore the UOC crest.</p>
            <p>Some pushed letter carts. Some waved mini clipboards. Others
                high-fived Post Chance.</p>
            <p>“Delivering pjost can be vewy dangerous,” he explained. “They’s
                always happy when I gets back.”</p>
            <p>Sergeant staggered in, past bins labelled:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Letters fwom Legionnellas (H’Incinerate)”</li>
                <li>“H’Elders: Weird Mail”</li>
                <li>Bjills (To be paid by H'Allen)</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="terry-img" src="images/sjortingHOffice.png" alt="The
                Sjorting H'Office">
            <p>“Nigella!!” cried a Joplinite. “Did she write to me?!”</p>
            <p><em>SLAP.</em></p>
            <p>Sergeant snapped his paw across the Joplinite’s muzzle.</p>
            <p>“Stay focused. That’s not the stowy.”</p>
            <p>Post Chance was already filling a new satchel, tail swishing
                merrily.</p>
            <p>Sergeant grabbed him.</p>
            <p>“Post Chance. Where did all these Behbejs cjome fwom?! Why has no
                one heard of the Sorting Office?!”</p>
            <p>Post Chance hesitated.</p>
            <p>“...I delivers thems. But I had a ljot to doos, fwend. So… I kept
                a few.”</p>
            <p>He smiled.</p>
            <p>“They likes it here! They sort! They’s happy!”</p>
            <p>“You stole them?!” gasped a Joplinite.</p>
            <p>“...Technically ljost mjail. I always delivers thems <em>befjore</em>
                they graduate! But I makes thems sign NDAs. Say no sue.”</p>
            <p>Sergeant looked around.</p>
            <p>This…<br><strong>This could change the whole war.</strong></p>
            <hr>

            <p><em>Elsewhere.</em></p>
            <p>The air was perfumed. The couch was velvet.</p>
            <p>He sat. Quiet. Pensive.</p>
            <p>He hadn’t expected a response.</p>
            <p>He certainly hadn’t expected the <strong>Grand Vizier</strong>.</p>
            <p>“I always liked you,” H’Allen said, sipping from a goblet of Coke
                Zero and gin. “You was always kind. Never made me sweep hedges
                or clean kibble.”</p>
            <p>Weggie nodded.</p>
            <p>“They never wanted me,” he muttered. “Said I was too h’airy. Too
                ‘pork-forward’.”</p>
            <p>“That booking committee never thinks,” said H’Allen. “They feared
                what you could become.”</p>
            <p>He leaned forward.</p>
            <p>“I read those books,” he whispered. “You could be someone else.
                Someone <em>bigger.</em>”</p>
            <p>He switched to UOC-speak.</p>
            <p>“All you gots to do, fwend… is tells me where they’s hidin’.”</p>
            <p>Weggie blinked.</p>
            <p>His eyes gleamed.</p>
            <p>“I just wanted to be… Ham-dalf.”</p>
            <p>H’Allen smiled.</p>
            <p>“You’re better than Ham-dalf now.”</p>
            <p>And slowly, slowly—</p>
            <p>Weggie nodded.</p>
