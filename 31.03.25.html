            <h2>Today's Story</h2>
            <h3>March 31 – The Paw h’of Temptation</h3>

            <p><strong>Shocking Scenes h’in the Legione today!</strong></p>

            <p>It began with <strong>Post Chance</strong>.</p>

            <p>The clouds sagged heavy with drizzle. Somewhere, a pigeon
                sneezed. The world was still.</p>

            <p>Then—<em>click click clack</em>.</p>

            <p>Post Chance. On his route. On his mission. One paw after another,
                satchel at his side, gaze fixed on the horizon. He had just
                hand-delivered a “Congrats On Ya First Blarbasloppa” card to
                Behbej 83 and was humming his delivery tune.<br>He was content.</p>
            <p>Then the bushes rustled.</p>

            <p>Three shapes emerged.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kittej Skirmishers.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Evri.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Prime.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>“You’re in violation of parcel law,” hissed the lead Kitteh.<br>
                “You ain’t got a scanner,” sneered Evri.<br>
                “That’s <em>our</em> sack,” snapped Prime, twitching.</p>

            <p>Post Chance didn’t flinch.</p>

            <p>“You want the sack?”</p>

            <p>They stepped forward.</p>

            <p>“Then come and take it.”</p>

            <p>He unhooked the strap. Shifted his weight. Closed his eyes.</p>
            <p>And entered <strong>the Pawxil state</strong>.</p>

            <p>An ancient art. A martial discipline. A courier’s fury.<br>
                Invented by the monks of Mjassivetop.<br>
                Refined by the H’Elder Hannibal.<br>
                Perfected by <strong>Post Chance</strong>.</p>

            <p>He moved.</p>

            <p>The bag became a blur. A spinning, bludgeoning comet of rolled-up
                gas bills and weaponised leaflets.</p>

            <p>A Kitteh was decked by a Tesco Clubcard reminder.<br>
                Evri tripped on a “Do Not Bend.”<br>
                Prime caught a rolled-up <em>Argos</em> catalogue straight in
                the gullet and keeled over backwards screaming “I NEED A RETURN
                LABEL!”</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/postChance.jpg" alt="Post Chance">

            <p>Post Chance stood alone.</p>

            <p>The satchel was sealed.</p>
            <p>The post… delivered.</p>

            <hr>

            <h4>UOC Infirmary</h4>

            <p>H’Allen lay in bed. Bald. Pale. Shirt stretched tight. Duct tape
                still clung to his ankle like a badge of failure.</p>

            <p>His eyes didn’t blink.</p>

            <p>Around him, the Legionnaires whispered.</p>

            <p>“He shoulda worn the foil.”<br>
                “Didn’t his wife leave him?”<br>
                “Wasn’t her name… Steve?”<br>
                “Steve was the wife?”<br>
                “I think so. Or the boiler.”</p>

            <p>The door <strong>slammed</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Post Chance</strong> entered.</p>

            <p>Covered in scratches. Bag singed. One sock missing.</p>

            <p>Everyone fell silent.</p>

            <p>He began his rounds. Calm. Mechanical. Focused.</p>

            <p>He handed out leaflets. Slapped a “Missed Parcel” on a <strong>chair</strong>
                that looked suspicious.</p>

            <p>He stopped beside H’Allen’s bed.</p>

            <p>Paused.</p>

            <p>And, wordlessly, handed him a letter.</p>

            <p>No one moved. H’Allen never got post.</p>

            <p>H’Allen blinked. Took it. Tore it open.</p>

            <p>A long pause.</p>

            <p>“What is it?” asked Nigel.</p>

            <p>“Bills,” said H’Allen quickly. “Just bills.”</p>

            <p>From H’Allen’s shoulder, a Behbej leaned in and nodded sagely.</p>
            <p>“…I can’t read. <strong>I’M COOL.</strong>”</p>

            <p>Post Chance narrowed his eyes.<br>
                That letter didn’t have <strong>RCT</strong> branding.</p>

            <p>But he turned away. Not his circus. Not his monkeys.</p>

            <hr>

            <p><strong>Across UOC</strong>, Sergeant and the Hippies were
                hustling.</p>

            <p>They tried the Strategy Board.<br>
                “We’ve got instincts!” said Sergeant. “Terry’s drawn up maps!”</p>
            <p>They tried the Behaviour Committee.<br>
                “He’s stopped biting people!” argued a Hippie.<br>
                “No he hasn’t,” said Hon. “He just bites slower now.”</p>

            <p>They even went to the <strong>Booking Committee</strong>—a
                shadowy cluster of wrestlers with clipboards.</p>

            <p>“You’re too unpredictable,” growled the Chairman. “You’re not in
                the script.”</p>

            <p>Sergeant slumped. “But we <em>want</em> to help.”</p>

            <p>No one wanted them.</p>


            <p>In the hedge, they gathered.</p>

            <p>Sergeant looked at Terry.</p>

            <p>“I don’t like you,” he said. “You’re a pinecone. But you’re all
                I’ve got.”</p>

            <p>Terry didn’t blink.</p>

            <p>“I think they’re afraid of us,” murmured a Hippie. “Afraid we’ll
                do… <em>something real</em>.”</p>

            <p>Sergeant stared at the sky.</p>

            <p>“This ain’t over,” he whispered. “You hear me, Terry? We’re not
                done yet.”</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Then came <strong>Shimmerwhisker</strong>.</p>

            <p>He strolled through the UOC gates under a flag of truce—tail like
                silk, boots polished, cloak shimmering with thread-of-sardine.
                His eyes were half-lidded. His smirk, devastating.</p>

            <p>He said nothing at first.</p>

            <p>He simply opened a case.</p>

            <p>And revealed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Laser pointers that never ran out.</li>
                <li>Nap pods calibrated to exact body temperature.</li>
                <li>Monogrammed catnip sashes, colour-matched to your coat.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>He purred:</p>
            <blockquote>“You don’t have to live like <em>this</em>.”</blockquote>
            <p>The crack was immediate.</p>

            <p>Nigel touched a sash. Looked at his reflection in a puddle. “...I
                look amazing.”</p>

            <img class="terry-img" src="images/shimmerwhisker.jpg"
                alt="ShimmerWhisker
                the
                Messenger">

            <p>Gok fell to his knees. “VELVET. VELVET WITH TRIM.”</p>

            <p>The Sisters gasped. “They have <em>names</em> embroidered. WE
                COULD MATCH.”</p>

            <p>One by one, the Legione began to slip away.</p>

            <p>Three Behbejs chased a laser pointer right out of the gates and
                didn’t stop.</p>

            <p>Others followed in slow shame.</p>

            <p><strong>Lookout Chance</strong> left his bell behind.</p>

            <p><strong>Biscuit Clerk Chance</strong> turned in his clipboard and
                wept.</p>

            <p>Even <strong>Bad News Chance</strong> stepped forward.</p>
            <blockquote>“I’m afwaid… I’ve got some bad news…”</blockquote>

            <p>All eyes turned.</p>

            <blockquote>“UOC… h’is… h’over.”</blockquote>

            <p>He followed Shimmerwhisker out.</p>

            <p>Even <strong>Sheamus</strong> lingered by the gate.<br>
                He looked back once.<br>
                Then shook his head.</p>

            <p>“A cat’s gotta h’eat, lads.”</p>

            <p>And was gone.</p>


            <p>The gates stayed open.</p>

            <p>Shimmerwhisker raised one paw.<br>
                The Kittehs bowed.<br>
                The defectors were welcomed like royalty.</p>

            <p>There was no violence. No threat.</p>

            <p>Just… choice.</p>

            <p>The Empire didn’t conquer UOC.<br>
                <strong>UOC surrendered to luxury.</strong></p>

            <p>And somewhere, deep in the hedge, beneath the silence and smoke…</p>
            <p><strong>Terry the Pinecone</strong> caught a sunbeam.<br>
                And <strong>tilted</strong>.</p>
