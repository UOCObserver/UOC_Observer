            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">April 2 – Shadows h’in the Hedgerow</h2>
            <p><strong>UOC had fallen.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>H’Allen</strong> lounged on a silk pillow the size h’of a
                mini trampoline in what used to be the Behaviour Committee Room.
                It now served as his private quarters and juice lounge. A
                servant fanned him with a flattened gas bill. Another tried
                desperately to remove <strong>Hannibal</strong>, still clamped
                to H’Allen’s leg like a small, furry vice.</p>

            <p>Every hour, a new medic was summoned. Every hour, they left
                weeping.<br>
                <strong>Hannibal had not moved.</strong></p>

            <p>The <strong>H’Empjire purred.</strong></p>

            <img class="img" src="images/behbejtraining.png" alt="Behbej
                Training">

            <p>Across the courtyard, <strong>Behbejs</strong> were being marched
                in double lines. Collars freshly polished. Paws cleaned against
                their will. Manners enforced by <strong>Kittling Drill Mewjsters</strong>
                wielding laser pointers and attitude.</p>

            <p>“THIS ONE BIT ME!”<br>
                “HE CALLED ME A WET SOCK!”<br>
                “HE SNEEZED IN MY WHISKERS!”</p>

            <p>One Behbej ate his ribbon. Two more joined in. Another simply sat
                down and refused to move unless given three puddings and a new
                name. The <strong>Kittlings</strong> were holding the line, but
                their fur was on edge.</p>

            <hr>

            <p><strong>The H’Emperor</strong> sat atop his throne of stacked
                Amazon boxes. His gaze swept across the ruined UOC courtyard —
                cracked tiles, biscuit crumbs, the faint scent h’of vinegar. A
                breeze carried the sound of a distant kazoo.</p>

            <p>His tail flicked. His ears twitched.<br>
                <strong>Cold. Snooty. Calculating.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Muldoon</strong> stood to his right. The <strong>Stooges</strong>
                flanked the sides like furry statues.<br>
                <strong>H’Allen</strong> hovered nervously behind, posture
                half-apology, half-panic.</p>

            <p>“Majesty,” H’Allen began. “Shall we discuss phase two—”</p>

            <p>But the H’Emperor rose slowly.<br>
                “I wish to walk the grounds. I wish to <em>see</em> what is
                mine.”</p>

            <p>“But, my liege,” H’Allen began carefully. “The grounds h’are not
                yet secure. Legionnaires remain unaccounted for. And there was…
                the incident. With Terry.”</p>

            <p>The H’Emperor stiffened.<br>
                His paw twitched.</p>

            <p>“<strong>Has the pinecone broken yet!?</strong>”</p>

            <p>H’Allen blinked. “My liege… it’s a pinecone.”</p>

            <p>“<strong>I know what it is!</strong>” snarled the H’Emperor.
                “That <em>thing</em> hurled itself at me. <em>At me!</em> It
                touched my <em>face</em>. That’s an act h’of war!”</p>

            <p>He hissed. His back arched. His tail flicked hard enough to knock
                over a clipboard.</p>

            <p>“And don’t tell me what he is, Grand Vizier. He is a symbol. A
                missile. A message. <strong>And he knows secrets.</strong>”</p>
            <p>A long pause. The air thickened.</p>

            <p>“If you cannot break him,” the H’Emperor whispered, “perhaps I
                was wrong to make you Grand Vizier.”</p>

            <p>H’Allen swallowed hard.</p>

            <p>“Perhaps… <strong>Muldoon</strong> can do what you have failed to
                do.”</p>

            <p>A single claw tapped against the stone.<br>
                <strong>Muldoon</strong> bowed, spun, and marched toward the
                interrogation shed.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>They came across <strong>Granny</strong>.</p>

            <p>Standing in the middle h’of the path.<br>
                Impossibly old. Absolutely unmoving. Staring at a brick.</p>
            <img class="terry-img" src="images/granny.png" alt="Granny">

            <p>The H’Emperor recoiled, eyes wide with disgust.<br>
                “<strong>Ergh. It’s disgusting.</strong>”</p>

            <p>“Granny,” H’Allen offered, not helpfully.</p>

            <p>“<strong>That is not one h’of mine! Get rid h’of it this
                    h’instance!</strong>”</p>

            <p>H’Allen sighed, picked Granny up by the scruff, and lobbed her
                gently over the hedge.</p>

            <p>She murmured, “Ooooh… closer to the oak,” as she vanished.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Then—<strong>Shimmerwhisker</strong>.</p>

            <p>He exploded onto the scene with the elegance h’of a disco on
                velvet. His cloak shimmered. His boots sparkled. His face did
                not.</p>

            <p>“My liege. Njews.”</p>

            <p>The H’Emperor purred.<br>
                “Ah. My messenger. Tell me of triumph. Tell me of obedience.”</p>
            <p>Shimmerwhisker hesitated. Then bowed low.<br>
                “The delivery dog, sire.”</p>

            <p>“Yes?”</p>

            <p>“He’s taken out three more Kittehs. A second Evri courier. And a
                Tesco home delivery driver.”</p>

            <p>A silence.<br>
                “We… we cannot stop him.”</p>

            <p>The H’Emperor’s eyes narrowed. His whiskers twitched.</p>

            <p>“Perhaps,” he murmured, “we do not need to <strong>stop</strong>
                him.”</p>

            <p>He turned, gaze sweeping over the blackened tiles and twitching
                Behbejs.<br>
                “Perhaps… we just need to <strong>delay</strong> him.”</p>

            <p>His head turned sharply toward H’Allen.<br>
                “<strong>Welease the Squire.</strong>”</p>

            <p>H’Allen’s eyes widened.<br>
                “My liege?”<br>
                “You heard me.”<br>
                “…It shall be done.”</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Somewhere, deep in the hedge…</p>

            <p>A Kitteh guard rolled on the floor, laughing at nothing, paws
                batting the air.<br>
                His mouth sparkled with <strong>super nip</strong> residue. His
                helmet had been drawn on with crayons.</p>

            <p>From the shadow of the hedge, a glint.<br>
                A blink.<br>
                A voice:</p>

            <p>“Units Windflower Syndicate, Tie-Dye Triumvirate, and
                Joplinites—wiv me. We’ve gots a postie to save.”</p>

            <p>Another answered.<br>
                “Units Hendrix Haze, Ginsberg Guild—continue the mission. H’if
                he’s h’in danger—extract. H’ufferwise… see what he knows...h'and
                somebody go get Gwanny”</p>
            <p>A rustle of leaves.<br>
                A paw signal.<br>
                The resistance moved.</p>
