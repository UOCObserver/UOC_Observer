            <h2>Today's Story</h2>

            <h3>March 29 – The H’arrival of the Kittej H’empjire</h3>

            <p><strong>Shocking Scenes h'in the Legione today...</strong></p>
            <p>The Daisies are coming home.</p>
            <p>There is no fanfare. No gallop. Just the long, muddy hoof-drag of
                the defeated. Their cowbells chime softly—cracked, dulled, a
                memory of better days. They do not speak. They barely moo.</p>
            <p>Last night had been the mission. The daring rescue. Muldoon, the
                Stooges, the legend of the lost expedition.</p>
            <p>But they were changed. Muldoon didn’t moo. He arched. McGee was
                grooming Dinozzo. Gibbs hissed at a beam of sunlight. They
                hadn’t been prisoners. They had been… adopted.</p>
            <p>The Daisies fled.</p>
            <p>The Kitteh counter-attack was swift and devastating. Claws from
                compost heaps. Catnip in the hedgerows. A decoy grooming brush
                that nearly took Daisy 9.</p>
            <p>One by one they escaped—scarred but intact.</p>
            <p>They reached the UOC perimeter just before dawn—Kittehs close
                behind. They expected help. Backup. Defence.</p>
            <p>Instead…</p>
            <p>Sergeant was in the hedge, lying on his back, whispering to a
                ladybird about whether clouds could dream.</p>
            <p>Two Hippies sat beside him, completely fogged out, sharing a
                carrot-shaped vape. One was humming to a rock. The other was
                cradling a pine cone named Terry.</p>
            <p>The lead Daisy blinked.</p>
            <p>"...Are we being hallucinated right now?" she muttered.</p>
            <p>No alarms. No scouts. No warning to the Legione.</p>
            <p>The Daisies looked at the smoking pit, looked at each other… and
                kept walking.</p>
            <p>They crossed the UOC boundary in silence.</p>
            <p>And collapsed in the garden.</p>
            <p>No words. No explanation.</p>
            <p>They simply lay down and began quietly eating grass.</p>

            <p><strong>It was the Behbejs who found them.</strong></p>

            <p>The youngest pups of the Legione—jack russell swarms of wagging
                chaos—spotted the fallen herd while chasing a blarbasloppa
                wrapper into the shrubbery. At first they barked with joy.</p>
            <p>“They’re back!”<br>“Did you bring gifts?”</p>
            <p>One Behbej tried to climb Daisy 3. Another brought a ribbon. One
                licked Daisy 12’s ear and got hay in his nose.</p>
            <p>But slowly… the tone shifted.</p>
            <p>The Shejf, veteran Behbej wrangler and former breakfast
                commander, stood back and narrowed his eyes.</p>
            <p>“They njur celebrjatin’,” he muttered. “Njur wagga h'jeven’.
                Surpderp h'erff.”</p>
            <p>He turned sharply. “Call Hon.”</p>

            <p>Hon arrived within minutes, eyes sharp, clipboard under one leg.
                H’Allen followed, loaded down with towels, oats, and
                instructions. He was already being shouted at by Daisy 4, Shejf,
                and possibly a crow. He sighed and twitched without complaint.</p>
            <p>The Daisies didn’t rise to greet them. They didn’t move at all.</p>
            <p>Only blinked.</p>

            <p>The Shejf pointed a paw. “Thinky sjew somethin’.
                Somethin’ bjurd.”</p>

            <p><strong>DING-DONG.</strong></p>

            <p>Nigel opened the door. And immediately closed it. Then reopened
                it, slower.</p>

            <p>Standing on the doorstep was a creature of immense poise and
                menace. Cloaked in plum silk. Rhinestone-studded gloves. A
                collar forged from gold and quiet fury.</p>

            <p><strong>The Emissary of the Kittej H’Empjire.</strong></p>

            <p>He swept past Nigel without waiting, paused only to stare at a
                portrait of St Chance, and then declared:</p>

            <p><strong>“Pwepaw your eyes. The H’Emperor h’arrives!”</strong></p>
            <p>With a dramatic flick of his tail, he stepped aside. And from the
                shadowed garden arch came the slow, majestic tread of <strong>The
                    Emperor</strong>.</p>

            <img class="img" src="images/theEmperor.avif" alt="The Emperor">


            <p>Large. Silent. Robed only in a golden collar and his own disdain.</p>
            <p>He walked with the grace of someone who had been watching all
                along. Who knew. And then—he sat.</p>

            <p><em>The air changed.</em></p>

            <blockquote>
                “Prrhhss-thhhhww… Tweaty Yarncord… fwagile thing… trampled by
                hooves…”<br>
                “Seven h’cycles. No mjilk box. No yarn offering. No apology
                truffle.”<br>
                “You have fwotten. You have bwoken. You have bwought war to the
                purrlight.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>Behind the Emperor stood Muldoon, wearing Kittej regalia. Regal.
                Fluffed. Unreachable. He held a golden brush and stared into the
                middle distance.</p>

            <p>A Daisy broke rank. “Muldoon!” she cried. “Please—it’s me. Daisy
                6. Come home. Remember the pastures. Remember your name!”</p>
            <p>Muldoon blinked. Licked his paw. Looked directly at her. And
                said, calmly:</p>

            <p><strong>“…Hhhssss.”</strong></p>

            <p>The Stooges followed. McGee leapt into a window box. Dinozzo
                rolled onto his back and began swatting at a ribbon. Gibbs was
                licking the Emperor’s foot.</p>

            <p>Gok the Fashion Chance clapped. “Oh my days, boys—this is a look.
                That velvet! That grooming! Dinozzo, you are serving Kittej
                Couture!”</p>

            <p>Hon stared at him. “What.”</p>

            <p>From beneath the sideboard emerged <strong>Sheamus Donnelly.</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                “Mrrhhwwrrr shhhh fttt chrrr tishhhtahhrr meowshhhh.”<br>
                “Whhhrrr... fwahhhh. Grrawh.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>Sheamus bowed slightly. His tail flicked once. Thoughtfully.</p>
            <blockquote>
                “H’Majesty… y’ve made yerself clear. This is a line drawn. H’and
                crossed. It’s a declaration. Sure as whiskers curl.”<br>
                “The Legione won’t take it well. But you’ve delivered it with
                elegance.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>He turned to Hon. “He says the Peace Tweaty is null. Broken.
                Forgotten. The H’Empjire is insulted. The Kittehs consider this
                a declaration of war.”</p>
            <p>There was a pause. “But he didn’t say when.”</p>

            <p>The Emperor stood. The Emissary stepped forward, flicked a velvet
                tassel, and hissed in nine syllables that made a Behbej pass
                out.</p>
            <p>The Kittehs turned. The Emperor departed. Muldoon followed.</p>
            <p>No one looked back.</p>

            <p>As the velvet tail slipped behind the hedgerow, <strong>Sergeant</strong>
                finally blinked and looked up from the ladybird.</p>

            <p>“…w-what did I miss?”</p>

            <p>Hon turned to face the yard. The Daisies. The Behbejs. The
                stunned silence of a Legione caught napping.</p>
            <p>He raised one paw. <strong>“Sound the Chance-horn.”</strong></p>
            <p><strong>“H’UOC is under siege.”</strong></p>
